# New Zealand Innovation Ecosystem Analysis

An interactive exploration of New Zealand's innovation landscape, built to demonstrate how AI can accelerate research synthesis and presentation.

## What This Shows

I took a 15-page static report and transformed it into an engaging, navigable website in a single afternoon. This project demonstrates:

- **Rapid prototyping**: From concept to deployed site in hours, not weeks
- **AI-assisted workflow**: Using AI to generate content while maintaining editorial control
- **User-focused design**: Making dense information accessible and engaging

## The Process

1. **Research synthesis**: Analysed existing reports on NZ's innovation ecosystem
2. **AI collaboration**: Used AI to generate structured content and HTML framework
3. **Human curation**: Edited, refined, and organised the output for clarity
4. **Deployment**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for immediate accessibility

## Why This Matters

In venture capital, speed and clarity are everything. This project shows I can quickly synthesise complex information, present it clearly, and deliver results fast without sacrificing quality.

The blend of AI efficiency and human judgement reflects how I approach problem-solving: leverage technology to work faster, but always apply critical thinking to ensure the output serves its purpose.
